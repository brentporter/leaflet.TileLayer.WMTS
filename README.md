leaflet.TileLayer.WMTS for ES6, etc
======================

Add WMTS layering for leaflet. I modified this from a modification by mylen - and he modified it from here:

http://api.ign.fr/tech-docs-js/examples/js/geoportalLeaflet.js

This was modified to work with the export and module functionality with ES6 and with webpack, etc.

I am looking to make another npm module that could be used with the CLI. More to come!
